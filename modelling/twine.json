Who was recently mentioned in an article with Angela Merkel? 1) Theresa May. 2) Sadiq Khan. 3) Richard Branson. Only one of the options is correct. Once the question has been asked, you can answer by either giving the name, or the number that preceded it. If you are right, you'll be asked about another person. If you are wrong, it's game over - you can use 'Start' or 'Play' to begin a new game. At any point in the game, you can use 'Disconnect' or 'Stop' to quit playing. If you would like to hear the question again, use 'Repeat'. To get these instructions again at any point, use 'Help'.  Would you like to start/continue your game?  [[Yes]] [[No]] ",
